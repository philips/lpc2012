			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The slides and videos for LPC 2012 are now available online at <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/resources-slides-and-videos/">http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/resources-slides-and-videos/</a> .   The list of videos on the website is complete &#8211; if you do not see a video for a particular session, that indicates the session was not recorded.  Also, please note that not all of the sessions have slides available &#8211; some presenters chose not to use them due to the collaborative nature of the session, and a few presenters have not provided their slides.  We have posted all of the slides that are available at this time.  In addition, if EtherPad was used during a session, those notes are linked from the resources page, so everything is in one place.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Ubicast for recording the conference sessions and providing video hosting services.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new BOF focusing on TI processors has been scheduled for tomorrow, 8/30, during lunch.  If you have any interest in the topic, or questions, there should be several experts available for discussion.  The BOF will be held in Nautilus 1.  There is also a BOF today at lunch in Nautilus 2 on C-state Governor.</p>
<p>BOFs are an important part of LPC and allow developers to get together to discuss a common interest. If you have a topic and would like to hold a BOF session of your own, contact a <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/contacts/" target="_blank">committee member</a> (identifiable by the green and gold committee ribbon on their badge, or see the list of committee members in the link provided) to schedule a time and location.  We&#8217;ll announce your BOF here and on our Twitter feed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing everyone at the opening reception tonight at the Sheraton.  The reception will be held in the Lanai area of the hotel, which is a grassy area out back by the water.  We&#8217;ll post signs in the lobby to help you find us, but the directions are simple.  From the main lobby, exit the back of the hotel onto the patio.  Go down the stairs and hang a right at the whale fountain.  Follow the sidewalk until you hit the reception area.</p>
<p>This reception is for LPC attendees only (and spouses with an event pass).  This is not a full dinner reception &#8211; we&#8217;ll have drinks and some cheese and crackers, so you should consider having dinner before you come out.</p>
