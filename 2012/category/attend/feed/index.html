			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LPC is right around the corner, and we have some great evening events planned for the conference. We hope you can join us!</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 8/28, LPC will be hosting a welcome cocktail reception at the Sheraton from 7:30 to 10:00 PM. Come by and have a drink, catch up with friends from far-flung locales, and meet fellow attendees.  We&#8217;ll be outdoors next to the water in the Lanai area of the hotel&#8217;s grounds, so bring a sweater if you get easily chilled. If you won&#8217;t yet have your conference badge because you arrive after the registration desk closes, we will have a list of attendees on hand so you&#8217;ll be able to attend without your badge. This event is open only to LPC attendees. Note that this event does not include dinner.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 8/29, Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) and Code Aurora Forum are sponsoring a reception for LinuxCon, CloudOpen, and LPC attendees at Bali Hai Restaurant, which has fantastic views overlooking the San Diego Bay. Bali Hai is located on Shelter Island, and we&#8217;ll be traveling to the event via water taxi from the Sheraton (or, you can get a taxi if you prefer). The event will include arcade games, a photo booth, and a classic rock band. Part of the venue is outdoors, so a light jacket or sweater is recommended.</p>
<p>Thursday night, 8/30, Intel is sponsoring another joint event with LinuxCon and CloudOpen at the Hotel Del Coronado, located on Coronado beach, one of the best beaches in the US. We&#8217;ll be having drinks and dinner out on the lawn, and making smores in fire pits on the beach. Again, bring a sweater if you tend to get chilled easily.  To attend this event, you will need to pick up an invitation at the Intel booth during the conference.</p>
<p>On Friday night, 8/31, we&#8217;ll be having the traditional LPC-only closing party at El Vitral, in the Gas Lamp District overlooking Petco Park. El Vitral specializes in gourmet Mexican food like nothing you&#8217;ve ever tasted before, and has a large collection of different tequilas and fantastic margaritas plus a selection of Mexican beers. Mexico is just a few minutes away from San Diego, so come enjoy some of the local flavors with us.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;re looking forward to these events as much as we are!</p>
