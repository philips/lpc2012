			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Program Committee has finalized the speaker line-up for the refereed-track of this year&#8217;s Linux Plumbers Conference. Final notifications are going out to all those who submitted a proposal, and we sincerely thank all of you for helping make Plumbers 2012 yet another strong edition in our history. As listed earlier, our Micro-conference sessions are also close to being finalized. If you&#8217;d like to participate as a speaker in any of the Micro-conferences listed below, please contact the runner for the event (listed on their individual wiki page), or contact us.</p>
<p>Please note that the Linux Plumbers Conference is still a separate conference from LinuxCon, although being run simultaneously in the same location. In order to attend both, you will need to register for both conferences separately. There are likely to be a few shared events, the details of which are being worked out. The invite-only Kernel Summit is also going to run at the same location in the same week, with potentially some shared events. Stay tuned, it&#8217;s shaping up to be a very exciting week for Linux in San Diego!</p>
